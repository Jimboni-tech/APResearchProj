ODINDOG is changing that by launching on Odin.fun, a platform that brings fast, low-cost meme trading to BTC.

Unlike traditional Bitcoin-based assets that suffer from high fees and slow transactions, Odin.fun has built a system that enables near-instant trades with 2-second finality and significantly lower costs than Runes. This makes it a game-changer for Bitcoin-based meme coins and positions ODINDOG as a potential first-mover in this space.

Here‚Äôs why ODINDOG and Odin.fun have potential:

Bitcoin is the OG ‚Äì Meme coins thrive on speculation and hype, and bringing that culture to Bitcoin could be massive.

Odin.fun eliminates the usual Bitcoin drawbacks ‚Äì No need to deal with slow confirmation times or ridiculous fees.

ODINDOG is the leading token ‚Äì As the first major meme coin on Odin.fun, it has a strong positioning in a growing ecosystem.


We‚Äôve seen meme coins on other blockchains explode in popularity‚Äîif the same happens on Bitcoin, ODINDOG could be one of the biggest winners.

0.112,0.758,0.13,0.8442,Maybe crushes are blessings in disguise,"very few folks have remained unshaken by the recent crypto crushes, especially the ones that have been occurring in the last couple of weeks. But, wait, these crushes, may be blessings in disguise. Let me explain what I mean. 

In Q1 of 2024, Bitcoin (BTC) surged over 65%, rising from $44,167 to over $73,000, a stark contrast to previous halving years. Unlike past cycles, altcoins also rallied despite global quantitative tightening (QT), fueled by Bitcoin ETF approvals and anticipated rate cuts.

However, in Q1 of 2025, a post-halving period that typically sparks an altseason, altcoins are struggling even with quantitative easing (QE) on the horizon. One key reason is that Q1 2024 absorbed excessive liquidity, keeping alt valuations high and reducing their potential for parabolic growth. Unlike past cycles, where altcoins entered the post-halving phase deeply undervalued, many remain too expensive for whales seeking significant multiples.

Other factors also contribute to the delay. The explosion of meme coins has diluted liquidity, limiting capital inflows into established altcoins. Macroeconomic risks, such as Trump‚Äôs tariff threats, regulatory uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions, have driven investors toward safer assets. Additionally, the dominance of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has funneled institutional liquidity away from smaller coins. Retail traders, many still underwater from 2024, remain hesitant to rotate into altcoins.

Furthermore, blockchain adoption has lagged behind speculation. Unlike previous cycles driven by strong narratives like ICOs in 2017 or DeFi in 2020, no new major trend has emerged to reignite demand. Meanwhile, rising yields on stablecoins and traditional finance instruments like U.S. Treasuries offer attractive passive income, diverting capital from speculative markets.

That said, the frequent market crashes could be a blessing in disguise. These corrections create conditions for whales to re-enter at discounted prices, setting the stage for a future altcoin rally. However, another key factor delaying altseason is the unusually high market capitalization of altcoins at present. Historically, alts have entered the post-halving phase with much lower valuations, leaving ample room for explosive gains. In contrast, the elevated alt market cap now makes it harder for major players to justify aggressive accumulation. With QE expected to inject fresh liquidity, institutional and high-net-worth investors may start rotating back into alts once conditions stabilize, but this process may take longer than in previous cycles.

While altseason may still arrive later in 2025, its delay is driven by a mix of liquidity exhaustion, unusually high alt market cap, macro risks, and shifting investor behavior. Until a fresh catalyst emerges, Bitcoin and Ethereum will likely maintain dominance, while altcoins remain in consolidation‚Äîpotentially setting the stage for the next wave of exponential growth.",1740441986.0,0.74,Positive
0.066,0.839,0.094,0.643,"Stop panicking, this is good","Its always entertaining watching the flipflopping of opinions in this sub. People need to recognise when they're presented with a good opportunity.

BTC has been consolidating for months and finally the bandage is torn off to properly retest the Bull Market Support Band. This happens every fucking cycle, multiple times. BTC can't constantly go up without testing support levels.

Alts are getting wrecked on their BTC pairs because the US is still in QT. By June, QT will end and Powell in the coming months will make it clear when QE will begin. There's a squeeze on finances and the labour market right now creating uncertainty. Volatile markets hate uncertainty and Alts are the most volatile of all assets.

There's a reason huge funds have been buying massive amounts of ETH and BTC over the past 4 months. They know QE will reverse the trend and BTC/ETH will front run alts, dragging up their USD and BTC valuations.

People calling for the end of the bull run have zero fucking clue what they're talking about. This cycle is more politicised than ever but if the trend isn't broke, don't bet against it. Alt valuations are essentially doing the same as early 2020 - reset all/majority of gains and rally following stimulus packages, QE and lower rates.

Can someone explain in concrete terms the business model behind Strategy?



The way I see it now:

\- It works as long as you can keep borrowing at low interest rates vs projected BTC price increase.

\- This is not an actual business. It needs the underlying asset to appreciate indefinitely. Unless Strategy becomes a bank and start offering loans in BTC.



At the same time he argues that the US should buy BTC to solve its debt problem. He suggested that securing between 4 to 6 million BTC would be sufficient to cover the entire US national debt. Wouldn't the US need to sell their BTC to clean their debt?

Or would they just give away their BTC to their creditors?

Considering that the value of BTC depends mostly on people's appetite for it, wouldn't this affect the FIAT value of BTC if the US reduces its exposure?



Short term this works well. Get the US to buy BTC for their reserve --> BTC price increases.
